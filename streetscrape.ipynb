Open 24 hours, processes applications 9–5, weekdays. Interpreter assistance will be made available for individuals who do not speak English. Subway: 2/4/5 train to 149th Street/Grand Concourse Station. Head west on East 149th Street toward Grand Concourse. Walk north on Grand Concourse two blocks, to East 151st Street and turn left. Walk two blocks to Walton Avenue. The PATH office is located at the          57 corner on your right. All families who are applying for shelter at PATH must have proper identification for all members of their household, such as: •  Any form of ID with a picture and proof of age, such as a welfare ID card, Green Card, driver’s license, passport or visa, IDNYC, or picture employment card •  Birth certificate •  Social Security card •  Medicaid card •  Identity card in the Public Assistance system •  If working, most recent pay stub Application Process Families with children must apply for shelter in order to ensure that they do not have an alternative housing option available to them. Once a family arrives at PATH, they will first be interviewed by a Human Resources Administration (HRA) caseworker, who will inquire about their living situation and explain the services that may help them avoid entering shelter- including family mediation, anti-eviction legal services, out-of-city relocation assistance, Family Eviction Prevention Supplement (FEPS), or a deal through HRA. If these services do not apply to a family’s specific circumstances, a DHS family worker interviews the family to obtain information about their prior living situation. Families may be assigned a temporary shelter placement for up to 10 days while DHS investigates the infor- mation provided during the interview. DHS determines whether the family is eligible or ineligible for shelter, based on whether they have fully cooperated with the application and eligibility process and/or have other housing options available to them. Every household has a right to a legal conference at PATH if they are found ineligible and disagree with the decision. In addition, they have 60 days after being found ineligible to request a Fair Hearing from New York State. What to Expect 58      Once a family enters shelter, they have certain responsibilities that they must meet, including obtaining and maintaining employment for all those who are able to work. With the assistance of their caseworkers, families will develop an Independent Living Plan (ILP), a document that outlines relevant goals to exit shelter and return to self-sufficiency. Now, more than ever, employment-focused programs and work supports remain a cor- nerstone of DHS’ efforts to help clients move back to permanency. Through DHS’ policy of Client Responsibility, families in shelter must actively participate in this process and take strides toward indepen- dent living. Families are expected to cooperate in developing and completing their ILP, which includes steps toward obtaining permanent housing: •  Applying for Public Assistance (PA) and completing all require- ments necessary for establishing and maintaining eligibility for PA benefits •  If able to work, actively seeking employment and accepting a suit- able job offer when it is offered •  Working closely with their caseworker or housing specialist to locate and view available apartments •  Actively seeking permanent housing by viewing available apart- ments several times per week \n",

All families who are applying for shelter at PATH must have proper identification for all members of their household, such as: •  Any form of ID with a picture and proof of age, such as a welfare ID card, Green Card, driver’s license, passport or visa, IDNYC, or picture employment card •  Birth certificate •  Social Security card •  Medicaid card •  Identity card in the Public Assistance system •  If working, most recent pay stub Application Process Families with children must apply for shelter in order to ensure that they do not have an alternative housing option available to them. Once a family arrives at PATH, they will first be interviewed by a Human Resources Administration (HRA) caseworker, who will inquire about their living situation and explain the services that may help them avoid entering shelter- including family mediation, anti-eviction legal services, out-of-city relocation assistance, Family Eviction Prevention Supplement (FEPS), or a deal through HRA. If these services do not apply to a family’s specific circumstances, a DHS family worker interviews the family to obtain information about their prior living situation. Families may be assigned a temporary shelter placement for up to 10 days while DHS investigates the infor- mation provided during the interview. DHS determines whether the family is eligible or ineligible for shelter, based on whether they have fully cooperated with the application and eligibility process and/or have other housing options available to them. Every household has a right to a legal conference at PATH if they are found ineligible and disagree with the decision. In addition, they have 60 days after being found ineligible to request a Fair Hearing from New York State. What to Expect 58      Once a family enters shelter, they have certain responsibilities that they must meet, including obtaining and maintaining employment for all those who are able to work. With the assistance of their caseworkers, families will develop an Independent Living Plan (ILP), a document that outlines relevant goals to exit shelter and return to self-sufficiency. Now, more than ever, employment-focused programs and work supports remain a cor- nerstone of DHS’ efforts to help clients move back to permanency. Through DHS’ policy of Client Responsibility, families in shelter must actively participate in this process and take strides toward indepen- dent living. Families are expected to cooperate in developing and completing their ILP, which includes steps toward obtaining permanent housing: •  Applying for Public Assistance (PA) and completing all require- ments necessary for establishing and maintaining eligibility for PA benefits •  If able to work, actively seeking employment and accepting a suit- able job offer when it is offered •  Working closely with their caseworker or housing specialist to locate and view available apartments •  Actively seeking permanent housing by viewing available apart- ments several times per week \", \"url\": \"www1.nyc.gov/site/dhs/shelter/families/families-with-children-applying.page\", \"locations\": [{\"name\": null, \"phone_number\": null, \"address\": {\"type\": \"PHYSICAL\", \"street_address\": \"151 East 151st Street\", \"city\": \"Bronx\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"zipcode\": \"10451\"}}], \"phone_numbers\": []}, {\"name\": \"ADULT FAMILY INTAKE CENTER\", \"description\": \"Open 24 hours.
