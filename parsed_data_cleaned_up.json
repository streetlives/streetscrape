Once a family arrives at PATH, they will first be interviewed by a Human Resources Administration (HRA) caseworker, who will inquire about their living situation and explain the services that may help them avoid entering shelterincluding family mediation, anti-eviction legal services, out-of-city relocation assistance, Family Eviction Prevention Supplement (FEPS), or a deal through HRA. If these services do not apply to a family’s specific circumstances, a DHS family worker interviews the family to obtain information about their prior living situation. Families may be assigned a temporary shelter placement for up to 10 days while DHS investigates the information provided during the interview. DHS determines whether the family is eligible or ineligible for shelter, based on whether they have fully cooperated with the application and eligibility process and/or have other housing options available to them. Every household has a right to a legal conference at PATH if they are found ineligible and disagree with the decision. In addition, they have 60 days after being found ineligible to request a Fair Hearing from New York State. What to Expect Once a family enters shelter, they have certain responsibilities that they must meet, including obtaining and maintaining employment for all those who are able to work. With the assistance of their caseworkers, families will develop an Independent Living Plan (ILP), a document that outlines relevant goals to exit shelter and return to self-sufficiency. Now, more than ever, employment-focused programs and work supports remain a cornerstone of DHS’ efforts to help clients move back to permanency. Through DHS’ policy of Client Responsibility, families in shelter must actively participate in this process and take strides toward independent living. Families are expected to cooperate in developing and completing their ILP, which includes steps toward obtaining permanent housing: •  Applying for Public Assistance (PA) and completing all requirements necessary for establishing and maintaining eligibility for PA benefits •  If able to work, actively seeking employment and accepting a suitable job offer when it is offered •  Working closely with their caseworker or housing specialist to locate and view available apartments •  Actively seeking permanent housing by viewing available apartments several times per week ", "url": "www1.nyc.gov/site/dhs/shelter/families/families-with-children-applying.page", "locations": [{"name": null, "phone_number": null, "address": {"type": "PHYSICAL", "street_address": "151 East 151st Street", "city": "Bronx", "state": "NY", "zipcode": "10451"}}], "phone_numbers": []}, {"name": "ADULT FAMILY INTAKE CENTER", "description": "Open 24 hours.
